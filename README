## Conky Rings Revamped

Hi,

The whole setup is based on Conky theme by YesThisIsMe, modified a lot by trollpunny (link in description).

There are four separate Conky widgets in the whole setup:
	- the main one with rings
	- memory
	- CPU
	- notes (lists the contents of tasks saved using the commandline tool task)

Use the startconky.sh script to start them in proper order.

Put all the files in ~/.Conky/ and run the script to start them. You can autostart the script at startup to make it
load at every boot.
